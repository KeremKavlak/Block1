2) in that area go on enviroment variables
3) For the follwing it'll vary on what you see
4) If you see a existing PATH section do the following
5) Click the value, select new and find the php section of WAMP64 \wamp64\bin\php\php7.2.10 is the location within wamp64
6) If you do not see an existing PATH selection do the following
7) Select New... > Variable name is PATH > Variable value is the path of the PHP in wamp so \wamp64\bin\php\php7.2.10




P.S an example of \wamp64\bin\php\php7.2.10 would be C:\Program Files\wamp64\bin\php\php7.2.10
